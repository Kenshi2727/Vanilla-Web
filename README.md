# ⚡ Vanilla Web

**Vanilla Web** is my return to the roots — a reminder that real developers can build without auto-complete, copilots, or frameworks doing all the thinking.  
In an era where AI tools write most of the code, this project is about **reclaiming the fundamentals** of web development through **pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

## 🧠 About

Modern development has become fast, convenient — and lazy.  
AI assistants, prebuilt components, and one-line libraries have made it easy to forget how the web actually works under the hood.

**Vanilla Web** is a hands-on exploration of:
- Writing structure with **semantic HTML**
- Designing with **clean, responsive CSS**
- Building interactivity with **Vanilla JavaScript**

No shortcuts. No abstractions. Just code that teaches.

## 🎯 Purpose

To unlearn over-dependence and rediscover creativity through constraint.  
This repo exists as a statement:  
> *“You don’t need AI to be a developer — you need understanding.”*

By stripping away the tools that think for us, we sharpen the skill that matters most — **thinking like a developer**.

---

## 🧩 Tech Stack

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**

That’s it. No React. No Tailwind. No frameworks.
